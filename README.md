> **How to use this README:** Maintain this single file throughout the project. Complete the Week 5 project plan first, then update the appropriate weekly section before each milestone. Be specific and honest: describe what you attempted, what worked, what did not work, and what evidence supports your conclusions. For every week, document each member's actual contribution. If a task was not completed, explain the blocker and next step. Do not include private or sensitive data in this public README.

## Remember - Best Practices

### Data access and privacy

[Explain where authorized data can be accessed. Do not commit personal information, private WhatsApp exports, API keys, credentials, or restricted grant/application records. Use synthetic or anonymized examples in the README.]

### Known limitations

[Keep a current list of what the system cannot reliably do.]

## Week 5 — Scope: Project Plan

**Deliverable during Week 6 Lab:** A project plan (write in this README file) describing your problem formulation, proposed approach, each team member's responsibilities, proposed baseline models with Hugging Face links, proposed evaluation metrics, proposed data with links, and goals for each week.

### 1. Problem formulation and social impact

- **Problem:** What specific task are you solving? [Write a precise problem statement.]
- **Intended users:** Who would use the system, and for what decisions or activities?
- **Inputs and outputs:** What will the system receive and produce? Give one concrete example.
- **Success criteria:** What would make the system useful and reliable?
- **Constraints and risks:** [e.g., privacy, missing data, hallucinations, language coverage, human verification]

### 2. Proposed technical approach

- **Pipeline:** [List the main steps from input to output.]
- **Baseline(s):** [Describe the simplest end-to-end method you can implement.]
- **Proposed models/tools:** [Name, purpose, and link to each Hugging Face model or other resource.]
  - [Model name](https://huggingface.co/models) — [What it will do; why selected]
- **Alternative approach:** [What will you try if the baseline underperforms?]

### 3. Proposed data

| Dataset/source | Link or access instructions                                   | Purpose                           | Size / languages | Privacy or usage considerations |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| [Name]         | [URL](https://huggingface.co/datasets) or other instructions] | [Training/development/evaluation] | [Details]        | [Notes]                         |

- **Data preparation:** [Cleaning, anonymization, annotation, splitting, deduplication, etc.]
- **Data limitations:** [What is missing, noisy, or uncertain?]

### 4. Proposed evaluation

| Metric / test                    | What it measures    | How it will be calculated | Target / success criterion |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| [Metric - e.g Accuracy, F1, AoC] | [Quality dimension] | [Method/ Formula]         | [Target]                   |

- **Evaluation examples:** [How will you build or select a development set?]
- **Human verification:** [If relevant, who will check outputs and how?]
- **Failure cases to watch:** [At least two anticipated risks]

### 5. Team responsibilities

| Member | Primary responsibility                            | Specific Weekly contribution | Planned next task |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------- |

## Week 7 — Evaluate: Results Checkpoint

**Deliverable during Week 8 Lab:** Preliminary evaluation results, metrics, development-set details, and 2–3 representative successes or failures. Include what you will improve next.

### Evaluation setup

| ---------------- | -------: | -------: | ------- |
| Baseline         |  [Value] |  [Value] | [Notes] |
